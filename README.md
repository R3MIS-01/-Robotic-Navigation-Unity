# Robotic Navigation Unity

This project is a simulation of robotic navigation using Unity, aimed at helping develop autonomous robot behavior in dynamic environments. The robot navigates a track with obstacles and uses various algorithms to autonomously plan its path.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** The robot is programmed to navigate autonomously through a predefined track.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The robot detects and avoids obstacles on its path.
- **Simulation Environment:** Developed using Unity for realistic physics and interaction.
- **Customizable Track:** Users can modify the track and obstacles to test the robot's behavior in different scenarios.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:
