# -Robotic-Navigation-Unity
A Unity-based project that simulates the autonomous navigation of a robot through a track with obstacles. The simulation focuses on programming a robot to navigate efficiently while avoiding obstacles, using sensors and algorithms for pathfinding, collision detection, and real-time decision-making.
